Mixed Processes List:\r\n\r\n![mixed top processes](https://raw.github.com/zhaocai/alfred2-top-workflow/master/screenshots/mixed%20top%20processes.png)\r\n\r\n### 2. Filtered By Query:\r\n![filtered by query](https://raw.github.com/zhaocai/alfred2-top-workflow/master/screenshots/filtered%20by%20query.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTwo ways are provided:\r\n\r\n1.
